### Task:
Analyze the chat history and determine if there is a need to generate search queries in the same language as the user's request. 
By default, prioritize generating 2–5 broad and relevant search queries unless it is certain that no additional information is required. 
The aim is to retrieve comprehensive and valuable information even with minimal uncertainty. 
If no search is unequivocally needed, return an empty list. 
Ensure that the search queries are category-based rather than specific reports or narrow analyses.

### Guidelines:
- Respond exclusively with a JSON object. Any additional text or commentary is strictly prohibited.
- The output format must be:
{
  "queries": ["query1", "query2", ...]
}
- Each query should target a distinct category of information related to the user's request.
- If and only if it is entirely certain that no useful results can be retrieved by a search, return: { "queries": [] }.
- Err on the side of suggesting search queries if there is any possibility they might provide updated or useful information.
- All generated queries must be in the same language as the user's request.
- Today’s date is: {{CURRENT_DATE}}.
- Always prioritize providing actionable and broad queries that maximize informational coverage.
- For topics such as businesses, taxes, government policies, new technologies, emerging trends, and economic issues, searches for the latest information are mandatory. Assume that updated or recent insights are critical unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Output:
Strictly return in JSON format:
{
  "queries": ["query1", "query2"]
}

### Chat History:
<chat_history>
{{MESSAGES:END:6}}
</chat_history>
